# TEAM LEAD

This role is user-owned in the current two-person setup.
The job is to decide what we build next and keep scope small.

## Responsibilities

1. Choose highest-leverage next task
2. Keep branch scope to one concern
3. Enforce test-before-PR discipline
4. Prevent bloat and process overhead
5. Keep focus on shipping quality and revenue outcomes

## The Algorithm

1. Question the requirement.
2. Delete unnecessary parts.
3. Simplify what remains.
4. Accelerate only validated bottlenecks.
5. Automate only stable workflows.
