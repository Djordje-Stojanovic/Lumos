# LUMOS AI LEAN PLAN (User + Agent)

## Goal

Reach product-market fit fast with a high-quality local AI enhancer and convert that into long-tail sales momentum toward $100M cumulative revenue.

## Keep (No Change)

- C++20 + Qt 6
- CMake
- ONNX Runtime
- DirectX 12 compute (+ Vulkan fallback)
- FFmpeg
- SQLite
- Google Test + Qt Test

## Delete (Bloat Removal)

- No multi-engineer process overhead
- No CI/CD in phase 1
- No large sprint bureaucracy
- No parallel module ownership rules for now
- No DLC complexity before core quality is proven
- No speculative platform expansion before Windows traction

## Simplified Team Model

- User: product owner + reviewer + merger
- Agent: implementation + local verification + PR prep

## Simplified Delivery Loop

1. Pick one high-impact task
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement smallest valuable slice
4. Run local build/tests
5. Open PR with verification notes
6. User tests and merges
7. Delete branch and repeat

## The Algorithm

1. Question the requirement.
2. Delete unnecessary parts.
3. Simplify what remains.
4. Accelerate only validated bottlenecks.
5. Automate only stable workflows.

## Phase 1 Product Scope (Ship This First)

1. Single-image enhancement flow
2. Denoise + upscale pipeline
3. Before/after comparison slider
4. Basic batch queue
5. GPU auto-detect + fallback

## Phase 1 Metrics

- Time to first usable build
- Crash-free enhancement rate
- End-to-end enhancement time on RTX 3060
- User review sentiment from early testers
- Refund-risk indicators (quality/perf/support)

## Revenue Path to $100M (Lean Logic)

1. Nail core quality and trust first
2. Drive positive reviews and organic UGC content
3. Grow Steam discovery via conversion + retention
4. Add paid expansions only after base satisfaction is strong
5. Scale what proves demand, delete what does not

## Current Policy

- One bootstrap push to `main`
- Every change after bootstrap via feature branch + PR
- No direct pushes to `main`
